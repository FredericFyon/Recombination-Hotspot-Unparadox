This directory contains the C++ code used to compute a 2-locus 2-allele infinite population model. In this model, there is only 1 PRDM9 locus and 1 target locus. We use this code for:
  1) given particular initial conditions, if the system converges towards (i) internal, polymorphic equilibrium or (ii) limit cycle
  2) compute different initial conditions and as such calculate numerically the basin of attraction of the limit cycle
  3) calculate numerically the period of the life cycle, as well as the number of generations spent in hot (Life Expectancy) and in cold (Death Expectancy)

The mathematica files present the code used for drawing Figure 2 (Basin of attraction of the limit cycle) and Figure 4.A (Periods).
